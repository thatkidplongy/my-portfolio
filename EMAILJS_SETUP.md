## 3. Create an Email Template
- Go to "Email Templates" in your EmailJS dashboard
- Click "Create New Template"
- Use this template content:

```html
Subject: New Contact Form Message from {{from_name}}

Name: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
This message was sent from your portfolio contact form.
```

- Note down your **Template ID**

## 4. Get Your Public Key
- Go to "Account" â†’ "API Keys" in your EmailJS dashboard
- Copy your **Public Key**

## 5. Create Environment File
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here

```
